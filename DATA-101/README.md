        - Predictive analytics
        - Prescriptive analytics
    - Benefits of data analytics
    - Risks of data analytics
        

## Chapter 2: Data Analytics Solution to Real-Life Problems

This chapter provides a recipe for data professionals that want to use analytics methodoloy and tools to answer specific business problems. The following topics are covered: 

    - Converting business problems into analytics solutions
    - Assessing feasibility 
    - Designing an analytics plan


## Chapter 3: Data Exploration

Data exploration is a key component of analytics because it allows practitioners to have a good understanding of the data and its quality. The following topics are covered:

    - The data quality report
        - Central tendency
        - Variation and shape
        - Skewness
        - Exploring numerical data
        - Organizing variables
        - Data visualization
    - Identifying data quality issues
    - The data quality report summary


## Chapter 4: Similarity, Neighbors and Clustering

Several data analytics methodologies rely on similarity. If two things (people, products, etc) are similar in some way, they often share other characteristics as well. Some data analytics procedures are based on grouping similar things and conducting analysis in each of the groups. In this chapter, we will learn about similarity and how to apply it in different tasks. The following topics are covered:

    - Similarity and distance
        - Euclidean distance
    - Nearest neighbors
        - k-nn algorithm
    - Clustering
        - k-means 
        - Hierarchical clustering

## Chapter 5: Fitting Model to Data

    - Linear regression
        - Simple linear regression
        - Multiple linear regression
        - Linear regression with categorical variables
    - Classification
        - Logistic regression
    - Tree-based methods
        - Decision trees
        - Bagging
        - Random forest
        - Boosting

## Chapter 6: Intro to Predictive Modeling

    - Variable selection
        - Backward selection
        - Forward selection
        - Hybrid selection
    - Model evaluation 
    - Hyper-parameter tuning 
        - Hyper-parameter tuning of k-nn
        - Hyper-parameter tuning of random forest
        - Hyper-parameter tuning of boosting
