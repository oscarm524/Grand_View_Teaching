# DATA-448: Predictive Analytics

In this repository, I store all the code presendted in the lecture notes of DATA-448.

## Chapter 1: Class Imbalanced Data

This chapter discusses some of the standard techniques that practitioners consider when it comes to imbalanced binary classification problems. The following topics are covered:

    - Performing classification on imbalanced data
    - Model tuning
        - Alternate cutoffs
        - Class weights
    - Sampling methods
        - Under-sampling 
        - Over-sampling 
        - SMOTE
    - Cost-Sensitive training

## Chapter 2: Multiclass Classification

This chapter discusses the two common techniques that are considered in multi-class classification problems. Multi-class classification problems involve classifying instances or samples into one class out of multiple classes (more than two). Each sample is assigned only one label and canâ€™t be assigned more than one label at a time. The following topics are coverd:


## Chapter 3: Feature Engineering

## Chapter 4: Hyper-parameter Tuning

## Chapter 5: Stacking Model Predictions

## Chapter 6: Intro to Deep Learning with TensorFlow

## Chapter 7: AWS SageMaker Best Practices
