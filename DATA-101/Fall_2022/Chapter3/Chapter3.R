## First we create the a vector that contains the values
x = c(0, 1, 2, 0, 4, 0, 1, 2, 3)

## Here we find the mean of the vector x
mean(x)

## First we create the a vector that contains the salaries
salaries = c(35000, 37000, 35000, 33000, 210000)

## Here we find the mean of the vector salaries
mean(salaries)

## First we create the a vector that contains the salaries
salaries = c(35000, 37000, 35000, 33000)

## Here we find the mean of the vector salaries
mean(salaries)

## First we create the a vector that contains the salaries
salaries = c(35000, 37000, 35000, 33000, 210000)

## Here we find the median of the vector salaries
median(salaries)
