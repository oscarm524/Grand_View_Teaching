# DATA-445: Applied Machine Learning

In this repository, I store all the code presented in the lecture notes of DATA-445.

## Chapter 1 

This is an introductory chapter to machine learning field. The following terms are defined:

    - What is machine learning?
    - How does machine learning work?
    - What can go wrong with machine learning?
    - Real-world applications of machine learning
    - Types of machine learning:
        - Supervised learning
        - Unsupervised learning
        - Semi-supervised learning
        - Reinforcement learning
        - Batch learning
        - Incremental learning
        - Intance-based learning
        - Model-based learning


## Chapter 2

This is an introductory chapter to AWS SageMaker. This chapter explore the main capabilities of SageMaker: building, training, and deploying of machine learning model. It also shows step-by-step how to set up an SageMaker notebook instance.

## Chapter 3

This chapter covers resampling methods, which is a crucial topic in machine learning. Also, standard methodology used to evaluate classifiers and regressor are discussed as well. The following topics are covered:

    - Model assessment 
        - Evaluating performance of classifiers
        - Evaluating performance of regressors

    - Cross-validation
        - The validation set approach
        - Leave-one-out cross-validation
        - k-fold cross-validation
