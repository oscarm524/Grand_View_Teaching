# DATA-448: Predictive Analytics

In this repository, I store all the code presendted in the lecture notes of DATA-448.

## Chapter 1: Class Imbalanced Data

This chapter discusses some of the standard techniques that practitioners consider when it comes to imbalanced binary classification problems. An imbalance occurs when one or more classes have very low proportion in the training data as compared to the other classes. Imbalance can be present in any dataset or application, and hence, the machine learning practitioner should be aware of the implications of modeling this type of data. The following topics are covered:

    - Performing classification on imbalanced data
    - Model tuning
        - Alternate cutoffs
        - Class weights
    - Sampling methods
        - Under-sampling 
        - Over-sampling 
        - SMOTE
    - Cost-Sensitive training

## Chapter 2: Multiclass Classification

This chapter discusses the two common techniques that are considered in multi-class classification problems. Multi-class classification problems involve classifying instances or samples into one class out of multiple classes (more than two). Each sample is assigned only one label and canâ€™t be assigned more than one label at a time. The following topics are coverd:

    - Understanding multi-class classification
        - One-vs-all classifier
        - One-vs-one classifier
        - Performance matrics
            - Precision
            - Recall
            - F1

## Chapter 3: Feature Engineering

    - Encoding categorical predictors
    
    
## Chapter 4: Hyper-parameter Tuning

## Chapter 5: Stacking Model Predictions

## Chapter 6: Intro to Deep Learning with TensorFlow

## Chapter 7: AWS SageMaker Best Practices
